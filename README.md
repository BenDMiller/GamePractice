# Overview

This is the beginning of a game that will continue to be developed in the future. I initially started this to help me learn about game developement in general, as well as increase my coding skills. It has now caused more ideas to come to mind, and so I will continue to practice and develop the code further.

I wanted to make a game to apply some of the object-oriented programming that I have been learning. I also wanted to create something that has a visual end result that can be experienced, rather than just typing into a bash or command line. This was one way to do so.
